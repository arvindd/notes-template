* This is a private note
Because "draft" is "true" above, this is a private note. To make it public, turn "draft" to "false".

Private notes are never built when built with hugo, or deployed on to a public website. They can be accessed only from local machines, or from a repo in github directly.

NOTE: If the repo in github is public, these notes can be seen by anybody too. If you really want a private note, make sure the github repo to which these notes are pushed is a private repo too.
